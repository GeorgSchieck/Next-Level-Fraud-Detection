Locally execute the codeTo locally execute the code and make use of the proposed ma-chine learning model:1.  Navigate to the folder containing the dockerfile usinga terminal.2.  Execute the command "docker build -t de_api".3.  Use  the  command  "docker  run  -d  -p  1213:1213de_api" to run the container.4.  The endpoints are: http:0.0.0.0:1213/post/tx5.  Andthepayloadis:Payload:"amount":[float],"type":["PAYMENT","TRANSFER","CASHIN”,”DEBIT”,”CAS HOUT”],”nameOrig” :[nameOrig(ktonr.ausDB)],”nameDest”:[nameDest(ktonr.ausDB)].6.  Use  http:0.0.0.0:1213/post/model  as  an  endpoint  totrain a new model. This can take some time and willreturn the duration needed to training.Use of the server-based versionIf   instead   the   version   stored   on   the   server   is   used,   theendpoints   "http://h2655330.stratoserver.net:1213/post/tx"   and"http://h2655330.stratoserver.net:1213/post/model"  are  needed.The payload remains the same as stated above.Locally run the website1.  Navigate to the folder containing the package.json us-ing a terminal.2.  Execute the command "npm install" (node.js needs tobe installed).3.  Run the website using the command "npm run dev".Notes:1.  It is recommended to use the website at "http://fraud-detection.schmidt-development.de/".2.  "http://h2655330.stratoserver.net:1213/post/model"will not work on the server because not enough RAMis provided.
